# Make-Code-Documentation

## What is MakeCode?

**MakeCode** is a platform by Microsoft for creating engaging computer science learning experiences that support a progression path into real-world programming. It is a FOSS (Free and Open Source) tool.

## What languages does MakeCode use?

MakeCode supports the following learning methods and languages:

- An **interactice simulator** which provides students with immediate feedback on how their program is running and makes it easy to test and debug their code.

- A **Block Editor** which can be used by students new to coding to construct programs. Colored blocks which can be dragged and dropped onto a workspace are used in this case.

- A **JavaScript / Python Editor** is also provided to help students use their preferred language to create programs. The editor features code snippets, tooltips, and error detection.

## Arcade Interface

The arcade's interface as shown below consists of the following:

- **A game screen:** This is labelled as `1`, on the leftmost part of the screen. It serves as the visual interface to interact with the simulated game. 

- **The code blocks:** This is labelled as `2`. It contains all the code blocks we can use in building our program - grouped into sections.

- **The scripting area:** This is labelled as `3`. It is the wide area where we place our blocks on.

- **Save project:** These are labelled as `4`. Clicking the save button will save our program, so we can return to it at anytime while clicking the GitHub button creates a repository for us, to hold the code used in building our program.

- **Undo/Redo and accessiblity:** These are labelled as `5`. Clicking the undo icon reverts the change and the redo icon can be clicked to take us to a more current phase. The zoom icons (zoom out and zoom in), can be used to adjust the size of the window we are working on.
