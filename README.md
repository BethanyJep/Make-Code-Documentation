# Make-Code-Documentation

## What is MakeCode?

MakeCode is a Microsoft product which can be used for creating engaging computer science learning experiences that support a progression path into real-world programming. It is a free, open source tool.

## What languages does MakeCode use?

MakeCode supports the following learning methods and languages:

- An interactice simulator which provides students with immediate feedback on how their program is running and makes it easy to test and debug their code.

- A Block Editor which can be used by students new to coding to construct programs. Colored blocks which can be dragged and dropped onto a workspace are used in this case.

- A JavaScript Editor is also provided to help students use Jasascript to create programs. The editor features code snippets, tooltips, and error detection.

## Arcade Interface

The arcade's interface as shown below consists of the following:

- A game screen: this is labelled as `1`, on the leftmost part of the screen.

- The code blocks: this is labelled as `2`. It contains all the code blocks we can use in building our program - grouped into sections.

- The scripting area: this is labelled as `3`. It is the wide area where we place our blocks on.

- Save and GitHub buttons: these are labelled as `4`. Clicking the save button will save our program, so we can return to it at anytime while clicking the GitHub button creates a repository for us, to hold the code used in building our program.

- Undo and Redo icons, Zoom icons: these are labelled as `5`. Clicking the undo icon, reverts the change and the redo icon can be clicked to take us to a more current phase.

The zoom icons (zoom out and zoom in), can be used to increase or decrease the size of the window we are working on.
