# Join Hour of Code as a Educator
Hour of Code courses are not just open to all to learn from, but to teach as well. However, teaching may not always be easy and in order to simplify the experience, Code.org classifies courses, recommending them by the [level of education](https://studio.code.org/courses?view=teacher#:~:text=Recommended%20Code.org%20courses) of the students as follows:

* *Elementary students* - [CS Fundamentals](https://code.org/educate/curriculum/elementary-school): blends online and "unplugged" non-computer activities to teach students computational thinking, problem solving, programming concepts and digital citizenship
* *Middle and high school students* - [CS Discoveries](https://code.org/educate/csd): empowers students to engage with computer science as a medium for creativity, communication, problem solving, and fun!
* *High School students* - [CS Principles](https://code.org/educate/csp): covers many topics including the Internet, Big Data and Privacy, and Programming and Algorithms. The curriculum is flexible to be taught as an AP or non-AP course
* *After CS Discoveries or CS Principles* - [Computer Science A *(coming soon)*](https://code.org/educate/csa): teaches students object-oriented programming using Java and helps them take on the role of software engineers, and practice skills that are used in the field

Code.org also provides access to their entire catalogue of courses from Code Studio as well as all of Code.org's 3rd party partners based on the following classification:

* [Elemetary School](https://code.org/educate/curriculum/elementary-school): Teachers say their elementary courses are "totally awesome sauce" and fun for all students, even pre-readers
* [Middle School](https://code.org/educate/curriculum/middle-school): Their new middle school course can be offered as a semester or year-long introduction to computer science for all students
* [High School](https://code.org/educate/curriculum/high-school): They offer two year-long courses for high school: an intro course and an AP course. Both are designed to broaden participation in computer science

## Tools and resources for your classroom

In addition to Code.org's courses, educators can use their App Lab and Game Lab in any course to teach students how to create apps, animations, and games in JavaScript as well as some other tools:

* [App Lab](https://code.org/applab): App Lab is a programming environment where you can make simple apps. Design an app, code with blocks or JavaScript to make it work, then share your app in seconds
* [Game Lab](https://code.org/gamelab): Game Lab is a programming environment where you can make simple animations and games with objects and characters that interact with each other
* [Web Lab](https://code.org/weblab): Web Lab is a programming environment where you can make simple web pages using HTML and CSS. Design your web pages and share your site in seconds
* [Video Library](https://code.org/videos): These videos can be used in any computer science course to support learning
* [CS Journeys *(New!)*](https://code.org/csjourneys): Bring CS to life and help students make real world connections to what they're learning. Empower them to continue their CS journeys with these resources
* [AI Module *(New!)*](https://studio.code.org/s/aiml-2021): Students will learn the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and machine learning and discuss their implications. Suitable for grades 6-12
