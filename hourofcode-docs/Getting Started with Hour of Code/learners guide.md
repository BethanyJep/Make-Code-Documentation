# Join Hour of Code as a Learner

The special aspect of the Hour of Code campaign is that it is an opportunity open to all people, regardless of their backgrounds. However, in order to simplify the experience of newer learners, the Code.org team classifies the courses based on the class a student might be in. The classification is done as follows:

* [Grades K-5](https://code.org/student/elementary): Learn to make your own game, app, or computer drawing
* [Grades 6-12](https://code.org/student/middle-high): Build real working apps, games and websites using blocks, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and more
* [Beyond K-12](https://code.org/beyond): Take the next step on your CS Journey. Explore career paths, extended learning, scholarships, internships, and more

These allow students to access the entire catalogue of courses from Code Studio as well as all of Code.org's 3rd party partners.

All this information can be found [here](https://studio.code.org/courses).
