## What and When is the Hour of Code

[**Hour of Code**](https://hourofcode.com) is a global movement run by [**Code.org**](https://code.org) that is aimed at expanding access of Computer Science education to all people across the world in a fun way through hour-long tutorials. Since its inception in 2013, the Hour of Code initiative has impacted millions of students in 180+ countries across the globe by helping them get their start in the world of programming and computer science.

For the year 2021, the celebration will take place between 6-12 December. The dates are in line with the **Computer Science Education Week**, however, you can host the session anytime.

## Why should I participate in the Hour of Code

Learning computer science skills greatly impacts children's problem solving skills and creativity. Currently, Hour of Code has over 400 partners with 200,000+ educators worldwide.

## Top Hour of Code Impact and Highlights

The Hour of Code has a tangible impact on people's lives, introducing them to this amazing world of computers and technology. One such example is Aditya Oberai, a Gold Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador from India, who started his computer programming journey during the 1st edition of Hour of Code in 2013. Aditya remembers playing around with the block programming interface on Code.org's platform to move around characters from the games *Angry Birds* and *Plants vs Zombies*, not realizing that he was being exposed to the concept of algorithms. That experience heavily influenced Aditya's perspective of technology, allowing him to perceive it as a tool that anyone could enjoy with while benefitting from. Aditya's journey with Hour of Code came a round circle, when his team comprising his fellow Gold Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors Simran Makhija, EKansh Gupta and him created an activity that was officially selected as a featured activity in the Hour of Code 2020 campaign.
