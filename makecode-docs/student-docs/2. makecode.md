## What is MakeCode?

**MakeCode** is a platform by Microsoft for creating engaging computer science learning experiences that support a progression path into real-world programming. It is a FOSS (Free and Open Source) tool.

## What Features and Languages Does MakeCode Have?

MakeCode supports the following learning methods and languages:

- An **interactive simulator** which provides students with immediate feedback on how their program is running and makes it easy to test and debug their code.

- A **Block Editor** which can be used by students new to coding to construct programs. Colored blocks which can be dragged and dropped onto a workspace are used in this case.

- A **JavaScript / Python Editor** is also provided to help students use their preferred language to create programs. The editor features code snippets, tooltips, and error detection.
