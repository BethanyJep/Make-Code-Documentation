- **A game screen:** This is labelled as `1`, on the leftmost part of the screen. It serves as the visual interface to interact with the simulated game.

- **The code blocks:** This is labelled as `2`. It contains all the code blocks we can use in building our program - grouped into sections.

- **The scripting area:** This is labelled as `3`. It is the wide area where we place our blocks on.

- **Save project:** These are labelled as `4`. Clicking the save button will save our program, so we can return to it at anytime while clicking the GitHub button creates a repository for us, to hold the code used in building our program.

- **Undo/Redo and accessiblity:** These are labelled as `5`. Clicking the undo icon reverts the change and the redo icon can be clicked to take us to a more current phase. The zoom icons (zoom out and zoom in), can be used to adjust the size of the window we are working on.
